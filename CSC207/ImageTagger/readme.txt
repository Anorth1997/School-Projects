About our features:

We have two features. First, we have an availableTags.txt which stores all the past tags that the user has used before, the user
can remove them if he likes, those tags can also demonstrate in our program if you click "Master Tag" button in home scene. 
Second, in CustomizeScene, you can check for all the image files that contains the input tag in textfield.
