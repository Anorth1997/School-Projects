"""
PlatformView: A visible Cheese or stool, which a cheese can sit on top of.
CheeseView: A visible Cheese object represented as a PlatformView.
StoolView: A visible stool.

Each PlatformView instance receives a Canvas instance. The Canvas class is a
class in the tkinter framework. The class is used for a place in a window
to draw shapes.

PlatformView objects draw themselves as rectangles on the canvas, to represent
side views of stools or rounds of cheese with particular sizes.

CheeseView objects can be moved and highlighted.
Note that CheeseView inherits from both Cheese and PlatformView

PlatformView objects receive a function to call in order to report to some
UI object (e.g. GUIController) that their rectangle was clicked on.
